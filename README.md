# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis



## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- The most significant variables/coefficients were provided through Ground Clearance as well as Vehicle Length. 
- The slope of the linear model is not gping to be considered as a zero due to the fact that the null hypothesis was rejected.
- The linear model does predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively as the r-squared value was fairly high.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
- The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Lot 1 and 2 do meet the requirements that are specific to the design specifications but Lot 3 does not due to the 170.28 variance which is too high.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs. Competition
Going forward, analyzing both the cost as the maintenance cost can be combined to determine the best route. I also believe the reputation would also be important to include. The null hypothesis would be stating that there is a difference between MechaCar and the competition. This will also give costumers better data to show why MechaCar is the better option to go with. A linear regression test would be the best fit to demonstrate the maintance cost/reputation with the amount being sold.
